## UX
--- 

### **Project Research**

Research for this project began with conducting user & competitor interviews. 

For _user interviews_ [Google](http://google.com) was used to search for software development recruitment agencies/software companies in Ireland.
Out of 10 queries sent, one response was received from Míchéal O’Maoldomhnaigh, the Managing Director of [Software Placements](https://softwareplacements.ie/)[.]()

Míchéal was happy to answer questions about the hiring process and a telephone interview was conducted on 09/02/21. The email thread confirming the interview can be found [here](https://github.com/FiachraCI/readmepractice/blob/master/README-files/user-interview.pdf).
Analysis of the interview can be found below in the [analysis]() section.

For _competitor interviews_, queries were sent to various owners of sites from the following links:
* [15 Web Developer Portfolios to Inspire You](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae/)
* [10 Full Stack Web Developer Portfolio to Inspire You](https://tamuk.quickstart.com/blog/10-full-stack-web-developer-portfolio-to-inspire-you/)

One response was received from Mathieu Schatzler, the creative director of the site [Wokine](https://www.wokine.com/)[.]() The email thread with Mathieu can be found [here](lorem), and the analysis can again be found below in the [analysis]() section.

**Research Analysis**

The _user interview_ with Míchéal O’Maoldomhnaigh yielded some surprising findings, most notable of all was the fact that in all of his years working in the software development rescruitment business, he had never _heard of_ or visited a portfolio site, and by extension,
had never based his hiring decisions based off of one. Míchéal advised that his go-to resource for aquiring new talent was [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com)[,]() and that if an individual wished to appear on his companies "radar" then they would habe to have a LinkedIn profile.
In [preparation]() for the interview this possibility was anticipated and a number of questions were prepared in the event this was the case. 

When asking Míchéal if there was anything that had prevented him from hiring someone in the past he mentioned that his company utilizes the boolean search function on LinkedIn by filtering the skills of the profiles, 
so by extension, unless the LinkedIn profile had the relevant skills section completed then they would not show up
in the results, which consequently would prevent them being considered for hire indirectly. Míchéal also mentioned that he likes to see LinekdIn accounts up-to date and fully completed with 
years of experience included, etc.

In conclusion, while the assosiated LinkedIn profile was always intended to be a feature of the website via a clickable link in the footer, the importance of having a fully completed profile was not fully appreciated
prior to the interview being conducted. As such, when the website is deployed, the associated LinkedIn profile will be fully completed with the most up-to date information and is intended to be an extension of the site. Based off of Míchéal's feedback, user's are likely to predominantly use LinkedIn
and the goal of completing the profile is to direct traffic to the website and vice versa. This will help to achieve the goal of leaving a lasting impression of the site owner on the user by virtue of having a portfolio site that many apparently do not have in this industry.



The _competitor interview_ with Mathieu Schatzler also yielded some useful information:

# Features 

### **Existing Features** 

After consideration of the expected users, and that these users are likely to be working in an office enviornment, the decision was made not to include any audio files in the site 
as this has the potential to distrupt others around them resulting in a potentially poor user experience.

The website has the following features, listed in order of appearance - left to right & top to bottom respectively on the website.

* Logo - this feature is intended to clearly convey the site owners name / brand, this also serves as an anchor to the home of the site as is convention.

* The Navbar - This is the heart of the site. The navbar allows the user to navigate the site from anywhere in the site that the user finds themself. It will have a 'mouse-over' feature to provide feedback about which link they are about to click. It will also be highlihted to tell the user which section of the site they are currently in.
The navbar will have three break points: sm-md, med, lrg.

* Interactive globe - This is placed in the center of the navbar on all browser sizes and will respond to the users mouse when moving in the landing page container. This feature is intended to convey the message that travel is one of the passions of the site owner and this message in reinforced later in the page. The interactiveness of this feature gives the user the ability to interact with an otherwise static site and is intended to be a memorable feature.
    
* Call to action button

* Scroll prompt - the scroll prompt is an animated feature which will be placed on the bottom of the viewport of each section, this will give the user a visual prompt that the site is one continuous page and is best experienced as such, and will hopefully prevent them from first navigating through the site via the navbar.

* Progress bars - this feature is is intened to give the user a visual representation of proficiency in the various languages the site owner is fluent in. This feature is intended to show both the skills and, subtly, any potential relevant weaknesses of the site owner at the same time, while emphasising the strengths as to not convey incompetence.

* CV Link - this feature is a clickable icon in the navbar/footer and opens in a new tab. This will open a downloadable pdf link to the site owners CV.
