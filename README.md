# **Fiachra Holland - Portfolio**

A portfolio site for a full-stack web developer based in Ireland.
The website features an initial landing page with a fixed navbar on top, and is designed to be one continuous page which scrolls through and _biography/skills_ section, 
followed by a _projects_ sections, and finally a _contact_ section & footer.

The main goal of the website is to convince prospective employers/collaborators that the site owner is somebody who they would like to work with. The site attempts to achieve this goal
by providing an insight into their life & work history, their skills in the various programming languages, and by providing links to their past/upcoming projects and repo files.

Owner goals:
* Establish an online presence
* Collaborations with other professionals on projects
* Gain full/part-time employment opportunities
* Portray interest/willingness to work charitable/non-profit organisations
* Portray their cultural and linguistic experiences
* Leave user with a memorable experience which makes them stand out from competitors

 General user goals:
* Assess site owners skills/weaknesses
* Determine if site owner the is right person for the job/project in mind
* Determine site owners availability
* Make contact to discuss employment/collaboration
* Determine if the site owner has anything to offer which makes them stand out from competitors


## **UX**
--- 

### **Project Research**

Research for this project began with conducting user interviews. Attempts were made to conduct competitor interviews, however, despite setting up an interview, the interviewee ultimately failed to provide feedback in time (see below). 

For _user interviews_ [Google](http://google.com) was used to search for software development recruitment agencies/software companies in Ireland.
Out of 10 queries sent, one response was received from Míchéal O’Maoldomhnaigh, the Managing Director of [Software Placements](https://softwareplacements.ie/)[.]()

Míchéal was happy to answer questions about the hiring process and a telephone interview was conducted on 09/02/21. The email thread confirming the interview can be found [here.](https://github.com/FiachraCI/fiachra-holland-portfolio-site/blob/master/wireframes/Gmail%20-%20RE_%20Contact%20form%20enquiry%20from%20Fiachra%20Holland.pdf) Analysis of the interview can be found in the analysis section below.

For _competitor interviews_, queries were sent to various owners of sites from the following links:
* [15 Web Developer Portfolios to Inspire You](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae/)
* [10 Full Stack Web Developer Portfolio to Inspire You](https://tamuk.quickstart.com/blog/10-full-stack-web-developer-portfolio-to-inspire-you/)

One response was received from Mathieu Schatzler, the creative director of the site [Wokine](https://www.wokine.com/)[.]() The email thread with Mathieu can be found [here.](https://github.com/FiachraCI/fiachra-holland-portfolio-site/blob/master/wireframes/Gmail%20-%20Competitor%20Interview.pdf)

**Research Analysis**

The _user interview_ with Míchéal O’Maoldomhnaigh yielded some surprising findings, most notable of all was the fact that in all of his years working in the software development recruitment business, he had never _heard of_ or visited a portfolio site, and by extension,
had never based his hiring decisions based off of one. Míchéal advised that his go-to resource for acquiring new talent was [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com)[,]() and that if an individual wished to appear on his companies "radar" then they would have to have a LinkedIn profile.
In preparation for the interview this possibility was anticipated and a number of questions were prepared in the event this was the case. 

When asking Míchéal if there was anything that had prevented him from hiring someone in the past he mentioned that his company utilizes the boolean search function on LinkedIn by filtering the skills of the profiles, 
so by extension, unless the LinkedIn profile had the relevant skills section completed then they would not show up
in the results, which consequently would prevent them being considered for hire indirectly. Míchéal also mentioned that he likes to see LinkedIn accounts up-to date and fully completed with 
years of experience included, etc.

In conclusion, while the associated LinkedIn profile was always intended to be a feature of the website via a clickable link in the footer, the importance of having a fully completed profile was not fully appreciated
prior to the interview being conducted. As such, when the website is deployed, the associated LinkedIn profile will be fully completed with the most up-to-date information and is intended to be an extension of the site. Based off of Míchéal's feedback, user's are likely to predominantly use LinkedIn
and the goal of completing the profile is to direct traffic to the website and vice versa. This will help to achieve the goal of leaving a lasting impression of the site owner on the user by virtue of having a portfolio site that many apparently do not have in this industry.



The _competitor interview_ with Mathieu Schatzler ultimately did not take place as Mathieu did not respond in time.

### **Wireframe Files**

As this site is one continuous page, one wireframe mockup per device - small, medium & large was created. The deployed site varied in a number of ways
from the wireframes. Throughout the project certain smaller aspects of the wireframes were found to be be not aesthetically pleasing, mainly the background colour going from staggered gray and white, to continuous gray in the finished project,
also the footer was given more sections and information.
* [Small Device](https://github.com/FiachraCI/fiachra-holland-portfolio-site/blob/master/wireframes/Iphone%20Wireframe.png?raw=true)
* [Medium Device](https://github.com/FiachraCI/fiachra-holland-portfolio-site/blob/master/wireframes/Ipad%20Wireframe.png?raw=true)
* [Large Device](https://github.com/FiachraCI/fiachra-holland-portfolio-site/blob/master/wireframes/Desktop%20Wireframe.png?raw=true)

# **Design**

### **Colour Scheme**

The colour scheme was based around [this](https://github.com/FiachraCI/fiachra-holland-portfolio-site/blob/master/wireframes/Colour-hex.pdf) hex palette. The white sections of the site ie the paragraphs etc are an off white rather that pure white, this
was decided upon to avoid a stark contrast between the elements.

### **Typography** 

Three fonts were used in the construction of the site. The fonts - Lobster, Poppins and Quattrocento were taken from Google Fonts. Lobster was used only for the navbar logo portion to make it unique, 
Poppins was used for heading and buttons, and Quattrocento was used for paragraphs.

### **Images** 

Background images and  the project sections thumbnails were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) (credited below in the credits sections). The background images were specifically selected as the aim was to subliminally suggest that
the site owner is unique, the background images in both the _landing_ & _about_ section feature a single leaf and tree respectively that stand out from the images surroundings. The background images have an opaque overlay on top of them. This was done to make sure the user was not distracted from the main content of the respective sections.

     
# **Features** 

### **Existing Features** 

After consideration of the expected users, and that these users are likely to be working in an office environment, the decision was made not to include any audio or video files in the site 
as this has the potential to disrupt others around them resulting in a potentially poor user experience.

The website has the following features, listed in order of appearance - left to right & top to bottom respectively on the website.

* Logo - this feature is intended to clearly convey the site owners name / brand, this also serves as an anchor to the home of the site and is placed on the top-left of the site, as is convention.

* The Navbar - This is the heart of the site. The navbar allows the user to navigate the site from anywhere in the site that the user finds themself. It will have a 'mouse-over' feature to provide feedback about which link they are about to click.
The navbar is designed to expand at the _sm_ breakpoint.
    
* Call to action button - this feature is on the landing page and is designed for people who want to contact the site owner quickly without having to navigate through the other content.

* Scroll prompt - the scroll prompt is an animated feature which will is placed on the bottom of the viewport of the landing section, this gives the user a visual prompt that the site is one continuous page and is best experienced as such, and will hopefully prevent them from first navigating through the site via the navbar.
This feature was coded entirely by [WEB CIFAR](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdxaLo9ALJgXgOUDURRPGiQ), specifically [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY1jeQGUiAI&t=57s) and full credit goes to the author.

* Progress bars - this feature is intended to give the user a visual representation of proficiency in the various languages the site owner is fluent in. This feature is intended to show both the skills and, subtly, any potential relevant weaknesses of the site owner at the same time, while emphasising the strengths as to not convey incompetence.

* Project section links to finished sites and GitHub repositories - as these projects are not real projects at the time or writing, the links are intended to convey their eventual purpose. The links in the meantime, 
are linked to [example.com](http://example.com/)
    * [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtWJRBdzanM&t=1594s&ab_channel=MDB-justcodeit) was used early on in the project to help with understanding the Bootstrap grid system.
    The code in the projects section was written entirely by me and is significantly different from the code in this tutorial, however, to be absolutely transparent I have included this tutorial
    as a source and leave it up to whom it concerns to determine if the code is significantly similar to warrant accreditation. If this is the case, then full credit goes to the author [MDB- just code it](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CF7mLQZhvx8O5GODZAhdA) where applicable.


* The contact form - this feature is intended for the user to contact the site owner. During the preparation call with the course mentor Dick Vlaanderen, Dick advised that as there was no
JavaScript in the milestone 1 project, that the contact form would not be able to me made full functional. Dicks advice, with the aim of providing a positive user experience, was to create a separate
page called confirmation.html which the _submit_ button of the form would link to. The confirmation page has a message informing the user that the submission is successful and that the site owner will
be in touch with them shortly. The confirmation page has a redirect function in the head tag which redirects to the main index.html page after 10 seconds.

* The footer - this feature is at the bottom of the page and has three sections: about, social-links, and a section that has a link to a downloadable CV. The footer is designed to be responsive and goes from
three full width columns stacked vertically up to the _sm_ Bootstrap breakpoint, to three columns placed horizontally for larger screen sizes.

* CV Link - this feature is a clickable icon in the navbar/footer and opens in a new tab. This will open a downloadable pdf link to the site owners CV.

### **Features to be implemented in the future**

* The projects section will be updated with any future projects.
* When JavaScript proficiency has been acquired more animation & interactive features will be added.
* A fully functioning contact section will be added when JavaScript has been acquired.
* The skills feature will be updated if and when new languages are acquired.
